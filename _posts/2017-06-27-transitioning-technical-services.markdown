## Introduction

This is an adaptation of a recorded presentation I presented at ALA Annual Conference in 2017. Below is a transcript of the presentation. This is part one of a three part session. Please feel free to contact my co-presenters, Maggie Dull of U Maryland and Eric Hanson of Johns Hopkins, for the rest of the session content.

## Overview

Today I’ll be opening up the session with some foundational methods and strategies for cultivating a successful training program. Throughout my presentation I’ll be using case-studies from both my former and current employers, so first I’ll set some former and current workplace context. Then I’ll describe strategies for identifying potential training opportunities. Next, I’ll talk about some pedagogical design choices for creating a training program. Finally, I’ll note some strategies for evaluating and adapting a training program in order to meet staff needs.

The content in my presentation comes from my experiences and experiences of my current and former colleagues. I wish to give credit where credit is due, so please be patient with me through the presentation.


## Former and Current Workplace Context

### Iowa State University Metadata & Cataloging

First, let’s set up some workplace context. I am formerly a metadata and cataloging librarian at Iowa State University Library, in a department called Metadata & Cataloging. The Metadata & Cataloging department is broken into three units: Serials and Metadata Cataloging, Monographs Copy Cataloging, and Metadata and Monographs Original Cataloging.

The Serials and Media Cataloging unit is responsible for cataloging and record maintenance of serial titles and media. This includes added copies, added volumes, transfers, withdrawals, and retention changes.

The Monographs Copy Cataloging unit is responsible for copy cataloging and record maintenance of monographs material. This includes pre-order bibliographic searching of selected firm order requests, pre-cataloging searching for automatic receipts such as approvals and gifts, cataloging monographs with Library of Congress records and most items with OCLC member-library records.

The Metadata and Monographs Original Cataloging unit is responsible original cataloging for monographs materials. This unit also coordinates metadata projects within the department.

These descriptions detail the core work of the department. However, the department continues to seek metadata partnerships with other departments, namely on collections within the library’s special collections and institutional repositories.

### NCSU Acquisitions & Discovery

I am currently the Metadata Technologies Librarian at North Carolina State University Libraries, NCSU Libraries for short. The department I work in is called Acquisitions & Discovery, A&D for short. A&D is comprised of three units: Monographs, Serials, and Data Project & Partnerships, DPP for short.

The Monographs unit is responsible for purchases, receipts, payment, description, and access to all monographic items and gifts. The Serials unit is responsible for purchases, receipts, cataloging, and maintenance of all serial purchases.

DPP, the unit I work in, traditionally provides data support for the Monographs and Serials units. This includes building and maintaining databases that help the other units with their core work, batch maintenance of bibliographic and authority records, and generating reports. However, DPP is currently forming new library partnerships and looking for new and innovative ways to provide data support for the library and wider NCSU community.

There are a few things to note about A&D. A&D is a fairly new department which resulted in the merger of an Acquisitions department and Metadata and Cataloging department. Throughout the first few years, A&D has prioritized cross-training all staff on both acquisitions and cataloging tasks, meaning that staff are capable of performing tasks involved in both acquiring and describing library materials.

## Strategies for Identifying Potential Training Opportunities

Now that we’ve set up some context, let’s talk about strategies for identifying potential training opportunities. The four strategies I’ll be talking about are implementing a skills brainstorming exercise, performing a needs assessment, needs identification via projects, and identifying needs through conversation.

### Skills Brainstorm

A topic brainstorming exercise is an exercise where you brainstorm and write down all possible topics in a given category or domain. We can employ this strategy to list potential skills, processes, tools, etc in a given category, in this case metadata. This exercise is good for casting a wide net and identifying potential skill needs from a high level. It’s also a good supplemental strategy for setting up a needs assessment survey.

Pictured is an example of a topic brainstorming exercise. Some colleagues and I in Acquisitions & Discovery were interested in identifying potential training opportunities for department staff within the metadata domain. We began this exploration by listing any and all metadata topics that came to mind. I don’t know how well you can see the image, but this included technology such as APIs, tools such as MARC Edit and OpenRefine, and standards like Dublin Core and Resource Description Framework.

Credit goes to my colleagues who participated in the brainstorming exercise: Sonoe Nakasone, Kristen Wilson, and Lynn Whittenberger.

### Needs Assessment



Needs assessment is a strategy for identifying needs in a targeted, controlled fashion. This is commonly done through a survey.  This strategy is good for assessing specific needs of a specific group.

One example of this is a cataloging competencies survey that was done in the A&D department back in 2013. This was shortly after the merger of the Acquisitions and Metadata and Cataloging departments, when A&D was prioritizing cross-training. In order to facilitate cataloging training across the department, a group of librarians led by Tessa Minchew designed a cataloging competencies survey in order get a sense of what cataloging skills staff in the department already had and in what areas the staff lacked knowledge or expertise. A portion of the survey can be seen on the screen.

Credit goes to Barbara Weinberg and Tessa Minchew who spear-headed this survey.

### Projects

An indirect method for identifying skills needs is by planning new metadata projects and services. This is a backwards approach in that you plan a new project or service first, identify any skills gaps that need to be addressed before staff can contribute to the project, then employ training that addresses the gaps. This is a good way to identify specific skills staff need and to apply training in a real-scenario.

### Schema.org Special Collections Project

As an example, let’s look at a metadata project. This project was a partnership between DPP, NCSU Digital Library Initiatives and Special Collections Research Center. The goal of the project was to enhance exposure to NCSU digital collections on the open web using Schema.org vocabularies. We wanted to programmatically embed Schema.org/JSON-LD into every digital collection resource.

There were two skills that staff needed in order to participate in this project: knowledge of Schema.org vocabularies and the Javascript Object Notation – Linked Data (JSON-LD) data format. I designed a two-part training series that gave staff foundational knowledge of Schema.org and JSON-LD. These newly-acquired skills were then directly applied to the project itself.

Training materials for this training series can be accessed at http://tinyurl.com/ncsuSchemaTraining

### Conversations

The last strategy I’ll talk is a little less formal. Simple conversations can be great for identifying potential training needs. This can be in the form of one-on-one conversations with colleagues, meetings, or informal chats. This method requires active listening, as opportunities may come at unexpected times.

![alt Conversations](/assets/images/conversations_001.png)

As I mentioned earlier, the Metadata & Cataloging Department at Iowa State University helps create metadata for special collections material and institutional repository resources. During my first few months in the department I had a conversation one of my colleagues Joan Leysen. She mentioned that at the time only a small handful of staff in the department were comfortable creating metadata for non-bibliographic resources, aka traditional cataloging. I saw this as a training opportunity and began conversations with Joan, my supervisor Lori Kappmeyer, and metadata colleague Kelly Thompson on potentially designing a metadata training program for the staff. I’ll talk more about the training program later in the presentation.

## Pedagogical Design Choices for Creating a Training Program

Now let’s talk about a handful of design choices for setting up a training program. In this section I’ll talk about this following: one-on-one training and mentorship, lectures, hands-on exercises, and workshops. I’ll give a use-case and example for each.

### One-on-One Training and Mentorship

One-on-one training and mentorship is like an apprenticeship: you usually pair a novice in a certain trade or skill with a seasoned professional. The use-case is when a staff member requires in-depth training on a complex topic. A good example of this is the time-old tradition of cataloging apprenticeship. Common in most cataloging shops, when a new cataloger enters the profession, they are usually paired with a seasoned cataloger to learn the cataloging trade. They usually go through a series of levels including cataloging foundations, copy cataloging, complex copy, and original cataloging until the seasoned cataloger feels the apprentice is ready to catalog on their own.

![alt Mentorship](/assets/images/mentorship_001.png)

It’s worth noting that this approach to training requires a lot of time and effort.

I also wanted thank Lori Kappmeyer and Joan Leysen for being wonderful cataloging mentors while I was at Iowa State University. I learned so much from them and appreciate their patience throughout the mentorship.

### Lectures and Hands-on Exercises

Modern lectures convey information through a presentation format, like this presentation! A use-case for this training method is when a group of staff require general knowledge about a topic or series of topics. Hands-on exercises are a good supplement to lectures that give the audience an opportunity to apply what they just learned to an exercise. This helps the audience retain the knowledge by understanding its real application.

An example of this method is a metadata training series I designed while at Iowa State University. I mentioned in an earlier slide that, based on a conversation I had with my colleague Joan, I began to pursue a metadata training opportunity for the Metadata & Cataloging department staff. This was a full-fledged training program that spanned two semesters. I began with foundational concepts behind metadata, then I progressed to topics such as metadata, content, and data value standards. Then I expanded to more nuanced topics such as metadata application profiles, metadata mapping, and local best practices.

### Workshops

The last method I’ll talk about is workshops. This method is very hands-on and is good for teaching a specific skill or tool.

An example of this is a URIs in MARC pilot that a few of my colleagues conducted. The goal of the pilot project was to explore adding uniform resource identifiers (URIs) to MARC records in order to prepare for future linked data in the catalog. The project group used this as a training opportunity and designed a workshop where staff gained experience with MARCEdit and MARCEdit’s linked data tools.

![alt Screenshot of MARCEdit](/assets/images/marcEditScreenshot.png)

The project group included Sonoe Nakasone, Lynn Whittenberger, Kristen Wilson, Lisa Madden, and Jennifer Solomon.

## Strategies for Evaluating and Adapting the Program to Meet Staff Needs

I want to briefly talk about some strategies for assessing a training program. I broke this down into two lists. The first list includes methods of assessment: iterative assessment and post-training assessment.

Iterative assessment is good for training programs that span multiple meetings or sessions. This is where you assess a program periodically and adapt the program along the way to meet staff needs.

Post-training assessment is good for short and lengthy training programs. This is a time to reflect on the program as a whole, think about what went well and what you would do differently. This gives you insight on how to better plan future programs.

The second list includes approaches to applying the methods: self evaluation, group discussion, surveys, and exercise review. Most of these are self-explanatory, except maybe exercise review. Exercise review is good for determining whether or not the audience understood the outcomes of a training program. This is usually done in the form of a graded exercise.

These methods and approaches can follow any combination. For example, during the two-semester-long metadata training I did at Iowa State University I performed iterative assessment in the form of self evaluation. I would take time after each session to reflect on whether or not it seemed like staff were grasping the concepts. I did determine that my pacing was a little off, so for the second semester I lightened the content for each session. This seemed to help.
