title: Testing Assumptions Through Survey
layout: post
---
This semester I've had the privilege of serving on a committee that is looking at ways to improve (unnamed) services. During this time we've discussed many issues and bounced around several strategies. The conversations commonly began with "I think they would do *y*" or "*X* would search for it *y* way". 

We drafted out a strategy and then designed a survey to see if our strategy was sound, in other words, we wanted to test the assumptions we had relied on during the draft.

It turns out only about half of our assumptions held true. There were several surprises we discovered through the survey, some good, some... that presented challenges.

Overall, I am glad we did the survey. I struggle with the imposter syndrome more than I care to admit. This was a learning experience, and I encourage others to test your assumptions as much as you can!
